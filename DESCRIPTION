Description: bnem combines the use of indirect measurements of Nested Effects
    Models (package mnem) with the Boolean networks of CellNOptR. Perturbation
    experiments of signalling nodes in cells are analysed for their effect 
    on the global gene expression profile. Those profiles give evidence 
    for the Boolean regulation of down-stream nodes in the network, 
    e.g., whether two parents activate their child independently 
    (OR-gate) or jointly (AND-gate).
